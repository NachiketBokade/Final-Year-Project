# Final-Year-Project
The Advanced Railway Ticket Generation System is a web-based platform that lets users book tickets online and receive secure QR code–based digital tickets, which are verified at coach entrances. A centralized server manages passenger data, payments, and waiting lists, making the ticketing process faster, safer, and fully paperless.
